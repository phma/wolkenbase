/* Adds together many numbers (like millions) accurately.
 * Each number is put in a bucket numbered by its exponent returned by frexp().
 * If the sum of the number and what's in the bucket is too big to fit
 * in the bucket, it is put into the next bucket up. If the sum is too small,
 * it is not put into the next bucket down, as it has insignificant bits
 * at the low end. This can happen only when adding numbers of opposite sign,
 * which does not happen when computing volumes, as positive and negative
 * volumes are added separately so that compaction of dirt can be computed.
 * 
 * manysum is suited to sums where the number of addends is large and not known
 * in advance and computing each one takes a long time. If the number of addends
 * is known, or a bound is known, in advance and the addends are calculated
 * quickly, it is better to allocate an array and use pairwise summation.
 * See matrix.cpp and spiral.cpp for examples.
