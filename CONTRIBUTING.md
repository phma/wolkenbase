# Contributing
Contributions are welcome, and can consist of code, documentation, artwork, or data. Wolkenbase does not yet have a mailing list, so [contact me](mailto:phma@bezitopo.org) if you're interested.
Some of the code is modified from Bezitopo, so you'll probably also want to read [Bezitopo](http://bezitopo.org/developers.html) too.
## Coding style
I've been working on Bezitopo for over twelve years, and my coding style has changed. The current indentation is two spaces; tab characters (optional) are every eight columns. But you may see other styles in some files.
New classes are usually with each word capitalized (e.g. `LasHeader`). But there are some uncapitalized classes still in the code.
## Units
All measurements of physical quantities for which an SI unit exists are in coherent SI units **except**

- local angles and some global angles are in fixed-point binary with 0x80000000 meaning 2Ï€;
- sleep times for threads are in milliseconds.
## Testing
When writing a new feature which can be automatically tested, write a test. Some test conditions cannot be written until the code is working. In this case, write the output of the test to a file (the PostScript files generated by `wolkentest` are this kind of file), inspect it, and write the test condition.

When writing code to read a file, fuzz it, so that the program is highly unlikely to crash when fed a file of that format, malformed or not. I use [American Fuzzy Lop](https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/AFLplusplus).
